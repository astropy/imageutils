Image processing utilities for Astropy.

* Code: https://github.com/astropy/imageutils
* Docs: https://imageutils.readthedocs.org/

What is this?
=============

This is an attempt to collect image processing utilities that are generally considered
useful for astronomers and propose to include them as ``astropy.image`` into the
Astropy core package in fall 2014 (before the Astropy 1.0 release).
The need for this became clear when Astropy affiliated packages started to re-implement
common image processing functions like resampling or cutouts.

The philosophy here should be to use `numpy`,
`scipy.ndimage` and `skimage` as much as possible instead of re-implementing basic
array and image utility functions. In many cases we will write a wrapper here that
calls the corresponding function e.g. in `skimage` or `scipy.ndimage`, but in addition has
an `astropy.wcs.WCS` object as input and output and updates it accordingly (think e.g. downsample or cutout). 

Contributions welcome!
(please start by filing an `issue on Github <https://github.com/astropy/imageutils/issues>`__ asking if
some functionality is in scope for this package before spending time on a pull request)

Related Astropy packages
========================

* The `astropy.convolution` and `astropy.wcs` sub-packages in the Astropy core.
* The `reproject` package which is planned to be moved into Astropy core as ``astropy.reproject``.
  It only contains reprojection routines that use WCS. Image resampling methods
  that don't use WCS info belong in this `imageutils` package.
* The `photutils <http://photutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/photutils/index.html>`__ affiliated
  package contains methods for source detection and photometry.

How to structure Astropy into sub-packages and which function belongs where is sometimes not
easy to decide. Please ask on Github or on the Astropy mailing list if you would like to contribute
something and don't know where to put it, or if you think something is really out of place and should be moved.
